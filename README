This is a repo for a wordgame created using C++ and SFML libraries.

Uses a text file containing a large amount of words and creates a randomly ordered array of them.
Words get randomly placed outside screen and move right untill word appears off screen and dissapears off screen
User types any word seen on the screen. Correct input increments correct count, errors increment error count.
User has one minute to type as many words as they can. At the end of one minute an end screen displays
total correct words and errors.
